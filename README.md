# Flappy Bird in Java

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the **Flappy Bird** game developed using Java's built-in **AWT** and **Swing** graphics libraries. It demonstrates fundamental game development concepts, including:
- Creating a game loop.
- Setting up a **JFrame** and **JPanel** for rendering graphics.
- Handling user input to control the game.
- Generating and animating obstacles.
- Collision detection.
- Maintaining a running score.

## Features
- **Flappy Bird Mechanics**: Click to make the bird jump.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Randomly generated pipes that scroll across the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions between the bird and the pipes or ground.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score based on successfully passed pipes.
- **Game Over State**: Stops the game when a collision occurs and allows restarting.

---

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional).

---

## Controls
- **Spacebar**: Makes the bird jump.

---



## Known Issues
- The game may lag on older systems due to unoptimized rendering.
- No pause functionality is currently implemented.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Implement a pause and restart feature.
- Optimize rendering for smoother performance.
- Add a leaderboard to save high scores.
